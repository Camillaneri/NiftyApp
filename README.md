## NiftyEvalue



### Purpose 

NiftyEvalue has been developed for evaluating the recommender system made by NiftyValue's team. Their algorithm measures low-level features similarity of the NFTs liked and disliked by the user and returns those images that mostly represent the users preferences. 
By interacting with the algorithm and answering some short questions about their attitudes and experience, we believe users will provide helpful information in ordert to understand how well the reccomending system works under a human point of view.

### Research

The first phase of our project consisted in the research of previous case studies  and literature about the evaluation of recommending systems. Here we tried to find those systems that better represented the functionalities of the one we were going to evaluate, thus we focused on papers about recommending systems based on low-level features similarity and concerning digital objects such as images and music. 

We followed Avazpour et. al study's classification of the dimensions used for evaluating a recommending system and chose to study ours under an **user-centric** point of view.

**Why?**

By using this dimension, ione should be able to measure quantitatively dimensions suche as utility, serendipity and novelty.

We detected in this field's landscape a taxonomy and a framework as we used as basis for our study study:

* **ResQue**: by Pu et al., is an holistic study on user’s perceptions and
impressions while interacting with a system;
* **Knjnenbrg**: by Kinjensburg et al., expands ResQue’s framework to context character-
istics by means of personal characteristics of a user and the situational ones,
in which the system is used.4 This framework uses specific terms as experience
and interaction, to distinguish between attitude and behaviour.

### Design 
As proposed by the latter work, we decided to design our study as the triangulation of three main typologies of gathered data:

1. **User chatacteristics**: survey 
2. **Subjective experience**: survey
3. **Behaviural data**: log-data
