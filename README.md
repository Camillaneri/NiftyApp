## NiftyEvalue



### Purpose 

NiftyEvalue is a user-centered evluation project aiming at targeting, and studying the low-level features similarity based recommender system devloped by NiftyValue's team.
We developed an application made for evaluating the user experience while interacting with the algorithm used by this system.

### Research

The first phase of our project consisted in the research of previous literature and case studies of   recommending system evaluation. 

We followed Avazpour et. al study's classification of the dimensions used for evaluating a recommending system and chose to study ours under an **user-centric** point of view.\\
**Why?**\\
By using this dimension we were able to measure quantitatively dimensions suche as utility, serendipity and novelty.

We detected in this field's landscape two possible a taxonomy and a framework as the base for our study:

* **ResQue**: by Pu et al., is an holistic study on user’s perceptions and
impressions while interacting with a system;
* **Knjnenbrg**: by Kinjensburg et al., expands ResQue’s framework to context character-
istics by means of personal characteristics of a user and the situational ones,
in which the system is used.4 This framework uses specific terms as experience
and interaction, to distinguish between attitude and behaviour.

### Design 
As proposed by the latter work, we decided to design our study as the triangulation of three main typologies of gathered data:

1. **User chatacteristics**: survey 
2. **Subjective experience**: survey
3. **Behaviural data**: log-data
